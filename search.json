    "text": "Productivity in the workplace is influenced by decisions that are made by management - not decisions that are made by workers. Investment in physical capital, like tools and machines, new technologies, and investment decisions are made by management. These decisions directly impact productivity. Well maintained modern machinery which is well maintained, will improve the workers output.\nWorker health is another important determinant of productivity. A healthy workforce is a more productive workforce. This includes sufficient rest between and within a shift, as well as sufficient time off for leisure. While workers have some control over their own health, sufficient time off to rest and recover is dependent on whether wages provide a minimum standard of living. If wages aren’t high enough, workers are forced to work overtime, take extra shifts, or pick up a second job to survive. All at the expense of leisure and rest time.\nThere are other determinants of worker health that are not controlled by individual workers, such as the maintenance of a safe workplace - both physically and psychosocially.\nA skilled workforce is a more productive workforce. But the ability to undertake training is also dependent on wages or other decisions of management. Workers should not be required to use their leave - paid or otherwise - to undertake training. Especially if there is no likelihood of increased pay in recognition of that training. The labour market in Australia is highly concentrated and workers are already underpaid relative to their skills.\nSo, when they say it is up to the worker to offer improvements to labour productivity, it is important to remember that productivity in the workplace is shaped by the choices companies make. As workers, our offer for improvements to labour productivity should always include increased wages and greater control over our work and the decisions made about it.",

    "text": "Productivity is measured across the industries that make up the economy. These industries can be described as market and non-market sectors. The market sector includes industries that produce goods and services which are sold at market prices. That means the price is reflective of the demand. The non-market sector covers education and training, health care and social assistance, and public administration and safety. Employment growth has been much faster in the non-market sector, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Share of employment in the market and non-market sectors\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of productivity in the non-market sector should be interpreted with caution. What is the unit of output that is being measured? For the education sector, output might be the number of students who graduate. In that case, measured productivity would increase by reducing the number of teachers - but that would reduce the quality of education and result in worse outcomes for society.\n\n\n\nProductivity across the market and non-market sectors, as well as the total productivity across the Australian economy, is shown in Figure 2.

    "text": "Inflation and Wages\nWhen discussing inflation, we need to consider the relationship between increasing prices and increasing wages. If wages are increasing at the same rate as prices, then no ones purchasing power is getting any better or worse. How this feels will depend on the historical relationship between prices and wages.\nThe Wage Price Index (WPI) measures the change in the price of wages. The real value of wages can be calculated by looking at the difference between the WPI, and the CPI, as shown in Figure 1. This shows that on average, prices have increased by 25.1%, and wages have increased by 22.1%. So in real terms, the purchasing power of the average wage has fallen by 3% - a decline in standard of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Change in real value of wages since March 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would this chart look like if the average worker recieved a 6% pay rise for the next year, and inflation grew at the RBA’s target of 2.5%?. Figure 2 shows that this would only represent breaking even with the real value of wages in March 2020. We’re a long far behind at improvingliving standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Forecast change in real value of wages since March 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent economists will use different prices to convert nominal dollars into real dollars. The one they choose will often be the one that tells the story they want to tell. Figure 3 shows a hypothetical the change in the real value of an annual salary of $45,000 between March 1999 and today, under three scenarios - wages offset by changes in consumer price index, wages offset by changes in the cost of living, and wages increased in real terms by 3% each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change in real value of an annual wage of $45,000 by comparison with CPI and LCI",

    "text": "Summary\nInflation has been a hot topic with cost of living increases, and interest rate decisions. Under neo-liberalism, inflation has become the single most important economic priority, coinciding with the increased dominance and “importance” of the financial industry and financial capital at the expense of productive industries like manufacturing.\nControlling inflation is seen as a more important policy goal than:\n\nfull employment\nreducing inequality\nhousing affordability\nalleviating poverty.\n\nInstead of full employment, government and institutions now push the “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment” which suggests there is a minimum level of unemployment necessary in order to stop wages growth and rising inflation. Of course, we can’t measure the NAIRU, only show that it might exist, if a bunch of assumptions are made about how the economy works. Estimates from data suggest that it falls somewhere between 4 and 5%.\nThis means that it is explicit government policy to keep up-to 5% of the labour force out of work, in order to keep inflation down.\nSuch policy might be palatable if there was a strong social safety net to support workers who lose their job and are looking for another one. Of course, we don’t even get that, with only the below poverty JobSeeker payment available.\nBut it is still a very inefficient use of the labour power that our economy has access to. Why shouldn’t someone who wants to work not have access to a job? It also means that policy is designed to discipline labour.\nWhich by the way, is why the budget in 2024, by the nominative party of labour, forecast that the plan was to tackle inflation by driving the unemployment rate UP to at least 4.5 percent by June 2025. Cold comfort for those who find themselves unemployed.",

    "text": "Definition\nInflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThe CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a “basket” of goods and services.\nBy their nature, averages are not representative of individuals. Statistical agencies have to make a lot of decisions when calculating price indices, including:\n\nWhat goes into the basket?\nHow should like items be grouped?\nHow should each group be weighted into the overall?\nHow often should the weighting change?\n\nUltimately, the basket of goods and services does not represent the spending or expenditure patterns of any one individual. There will be a disconnect between how the CPI is reported, and how you feel it as an individual.\nFor example, in 2025 the weight of tobacco in the CPI was reduced because tobacco sales fell as fewer people are smoking. That means increases in the price of cigarettes don’t impact on the overall CPI as much. So smokers will feel that prices are increasing faster than the CPI.\nAnother disconnect between reporting of the CPI and worker experiences is that mortgage payments are excluded from the housing element of the CPI - only the price of a new home (excluding land) and changes in the price of rents are included.\nCPI data is reported as an index, or as a % change compared to the previous quarter, or previous year. An index shows how prices have changed relative to a value of 100 in a reference period. A percentage change measures the relative change in prices compared to another period.",

    "text": "History of Economics\nWhat follow is a rather dry history of different people and ideas. It’s included here for those who want to know more.\nBut the quick summary is:\nThe study of economics has always been a reflection of the politics of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1600s, the dominant ideology of Britain was mercantilism, based on the growing power of Britain, and the vast trade networks they had developed through colonialism.\nThe economics of the time was a reflection of this ideology, highlighting the ways in which trade was important for a country’s economic development.\nEconomists argued for increased power of the state (to strengthen colonial power) and for government’s to maintain a trade surplus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn France, about 100 years later, the physiocrats considered two distinct industries - agricultural, and non-agricultural, in reflection of the growing industrialisation in workshops and of artisans.\nThe physiocrats believed that only agricultural labour could create value in the products of society, and that non-agricultural labour was unproductive.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Agriculture\n\nPre-agriculture, in hunter-gatherer communities, you collect what you need to live in the short term/day to day\nWhat happens after the invention of agriculture? Now we’re capable of producing more than we need to stay alive. What happens to surplus food? Who controls the surplus? How is the surplus distributed?\n\n\n\nClassical Economics\nWith the industrial revolution came classical economics. Adam Smith, in trying to understand why some countries were more wealthy than others, speculated that productivity could be improved if wokers specialised in one step of a process, rather than the whole chain.\nThe description of economics is again a reflection of the political. The amount of work undertaken in factories, and the use of machines in production were both rapidly increasing - and so that was how Smith framed the economy.\nAdam Smith is seen by some as the inventor of “free market economics”. But Smith was strongly opposed to monopolies, and recognised the importance of class, compared to individual.\nSome ideas have lasted longer than others. Smith’s division of labour is still popular today. Others, like Malthus who argued that unstable population growth would occur if wages ever grew beyond what workers needed to survive, have mostly died out. David Ricardo invented a theory of free trade which said that all economies are made better off by specialising in the industry they have comparative advantage1 which is only true if capital and labour can not move between countries. That doesn’t stop advocates of free trade using this argument today.\nMarxism was a response to the conditions under which labour was treated during the industrial period, including long hours, terrible conditions, high death rates, child labour, and the growing and obvious disparities in wealth between the owners of capital, and those who had to work for a living. One insight from Marxism about capitalism is “the tendency for the rate of profit to fall”, which is an observation that the rate of profit able to be extracted for a given amount of invested capital decreases over time. I think that such a theory explains a lot about the development of capitalism and economics since the 1900s.\n\n\nThe Golden Age of Capitalism\n\npost world war 2\n\n\n\nNeoclassical Economics\nThe neoclassi\nFocus on the individual, and equilibrium in markets. Bring in mathematics and models to try and answer economic questions. Neoclassical theories are based on abstract ideas, rather than the visible realities. Stuff like:\n\nEveryone is born with some endowment of labour power, skill, or another resource.\nEveryone is born with a set of preferences which determine what they like to consume.\nTechnology converts endowments into usable goods and services.\nTrading through markets makes sure that everything is optimal.\n\nWhich leads to the conclusion that:\n\nthe market fixes everything and;\nprofit represents the productivity of owned capital - and it is morally justifiable - just explain away the exploitation.\n\nBrief interlude with Keynesianism (explicitly a response to the great depression)- the situation won’t resolve itself, and government can stop unemployment by boosting demand (govt spending, taxation, interest rates)\nBut the return in the 1970s of neoclassical economics (explicitly a response to the stagflation of the 1970s), consolidated today as neoliberalism returns us back to the market solving everyone’s problems.\nThe most important message is:\n\nEconomics reflects the the political ideology, not the other way around!\nEconomists (as social scientists) have ideas about ways that the economy should function\n“Classical” economics is associated with the development of capitalism and the industrial revolution in the late 1700 and early 1800s.\nMarxism was a response to the horrible working conditions under which labour was subjected during the industrial revolution - and the associated disparity between capital class and working class.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\nIf you want to get really deep into the weeds. But fair warning - these books are long, dry, and hard to read.\nClassical Economics\nAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Smith 1776)\nOn the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (Ricardo 1817)",

But profit itself is not a productive activity - but a social relationship between owner, worker, and capital.

Productivity increases from the increased division of labour rapidly increased profits. SOME of these profits were re-invested into production - both to maintain machinery, and to improve processes. Of course, some of the profits were consumed by the ‘capitalist fat cat’ - which is why they’re always depicted as such during this period.\n\nEverything in the economy comes from some combination of work and the natural environment, but only work can “add value”\nThere have been many attempts to define value - but clearly productive labour is the only source of it.\nCapital is not inherently ‘productive’, despite being paid profit.",

    "text": "Class Consciousness and Solidarity\n\nCapitalists understand the importance of class solidarity.\nIdentity politics, culture war, woke vs. anti-woke, etc. are tools used to keep the working class from building solidarity.\n\nClass solidarity is important - in a positive and negative sense. Capitalists maintain strong class consciousness and solidarity, and work hard to prevent solidarity forming in other classes.\nWhen the economy was based on manufacturing and heavy industry like mining, steel working, and shipbuilding, it was very easy to characterize the classes.\nA small number of people owned capital in the form of a factory, or mine - or occasionally - state run monopolies in sectors like automotive manufacturing - with very few ‘supervisors’.\nThe division of labour was stark - you had workers on one side and the bosses or state on the other. Most households were proletarian or “working class” and the bosses were the bourgeois or capitalist class.\n\nSee: the Simpsons nuclear power plant.\n\nThis period coincides with strong trade union membership, a strong sense of working class identity, and a strong understanding of the power that existed in its collectivism.\nThe theoretical underpinning behind class is rooted in the relationship between individual and the means of production. If you didn’t own the equipment which made the product you were working class.\nBeyond the theoretical (or economical), there are social elements to class as well - including culture, pastimes, institutions, even where you live.\nPost the 1960s, the decline in mining, construction, and manufacturing resulted in a change in the structure of the economy - away from manual work, and towards clerical, administrative, and supervisory work - the white collar. Advances in technology further resulted in increases in technician or supervisory, foreman style work at the expense of manual labour.\nRatio of services output to manufacturing output.\nThis has had a huge impact on trade union density.\nJust as the capitalist today is aesthetically different from the factory owner of the industrial revolution, so too has the working class changed.\nIt isn’t as easy today to spot the capitalist class. Unlike in the industrial revolution, the company owner is unlikely to be on the factory floor - patrolling and keeping everyone in line. The modern capitalist tries to trade on the aesthetics of the working class.\nThe concentration of wealth among the capital class however, has only increased since the industrial age. More and more wealth is held by fewer and fewer people. Owning shares, or investing in a mutual fund, does not make you a member of the capitalist class.",

    "text": "Summary\nProductivity is a widely reported but commonly misunderstood economic indicator. People, especially bosses, economists, and industry groups like to talk about it, but don’t seem to understand what it is. In a Fair Work Commission (FWC) hearing in 2025, the chief economist of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was asked what factors drove productivity and said:\n\n“the Productivity Commission was currently examining those factors”\n\nYou would hope that after 35 years of existence, the productivity commission already knew what factors drive productivity.\nThe conversation also fails to consider who benefits from increases to productivity.\n\nThey SayWe Say\n\n\nAndrew McKellar, Chief Executive Officer, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry\n\nFrom a business point of view, we’re very happy to sit down and work with the trade union movement. But we want to get a strategy that’s built around how we improve productivity.\n\n\n[…] unions need to moderate their wage claims, and offer measures to improve labour productivity.\n\n\n\n\nDecisions which impact productivity in the workplace are made by management, not by workers.\n\n\n\n\nThis article describes how productivity is measured and provides an overview of the drivers of productivity, and more importantly, who in the workplace is responsible for implementing those drivers.",

It shows that the benefits of increased productivity have not been passed on to workers since about 2000. The attempts by industry groups and the Reserve Bank to now tie future wage increases to productivity growth is an attempt at locking in the gains made by business owners at workers expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Productivity (output per hour) in comparison with real compensation for workers per hour",
