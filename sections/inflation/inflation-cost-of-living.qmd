# Cost of Living

The CPI is not a measure of the cost of living. In fact there is no definitive cost of living measure collected by the ABS but the ABS does collect a living cost index, which looks at different household types expenditure patterns.

The living cost index asks "By how much would after tax money incomes need to change to allow households to purchase the same quantity of consumer goods and services that they purchased in the base period?"
